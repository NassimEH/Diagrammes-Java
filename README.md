# Java Database and Chart Application

### My Java-based Chart Generation Tool

This project is a Java-based application designed as a student project in collaboration with Marjorie Daveluy and Lucile Pereira. Our goal was to develop a sophisticated tool that not only interacts with databases but also generates pie charts based on the data retrieved. Utilizing Java for the core functionality and integrating database access, this endeavor allowed us to explore the dynamic interaction between software and data. By incorporating Java Swing, we crafted a user-friendly graphical interface that facilitates data visualization through pie charts. Our project stands out for its professional and intuitive interface, equipped with features like dynamic data retrieval, chart customization, and interactive data exploration. Through this project, we have successfully combined data management with visual analytics, showcasing our ability to handle complex software development challenges.

### What I Have Learned During This Project

Our project, a Java-based application developed in collaboration with Marjorie Daveluy and Lucile Pereira, marks my first significant foray into integrating Java with database access and chart generation. This experience not only solidified my understanding of Java but also expanded my skills in database interaction and dynamic chart creation using Java Swing. The application's development included functionalities such as querying databases, processing data, and generating interactive pie charts. This comprehensive experience has greatly enhanced my coding skills, deepened my understanding of software architecture, and introduced me to the principles of visual data representation, refining my ability to develop data-driven and interactive applications.
